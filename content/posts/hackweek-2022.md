This year we had our first hackathon at StructionSite which we called Hackweek. It was a week-long event where folks from the engineering team paused the normal roadmap and worked on projects that they pitched.

The goal of Hackweek was to exercise our creativity, work with different team members, and explore new technologies, approaches, and ideas.

It ended with a demo session where each team presented their prototype, spike, or learnings to the rest of the R&D org.

# Announcing Hackweek

After putting together the outline and schedule, we announced the even in Slack and shared the details. This was followed by an optional 15 minute call to go over the event and answer questions.

# Pitch a Project

We asked for a few things in the pitch, starting with a high level description. What is the project? What problem does it solve? Why are you excited about it?

Next, what will you demo at the end of the week? How does the scope fit into a week?

Finally, what skills do you need on your team? Frontend, backend, ML/CV, mobile, design, data?

Standardizing the pitch template helped align projects with the goals of the event. It also helped make sure everyone had enough information to rank the projects they wanted to work on.

# Forming Teams

Once the pitches were submitted, we sent out a form asking participants to rank the top three projects they wanted to work on.

Using the project ranking, we formed teams by matching folks to their top project while keeping the team size balanced. We also wanted to take the opportunity to put people who don't normally work together on the same team.

This worked out surprisingly well - almost everyone ended up on their top rated project and the rest were matched with their second choice. We ended up with four teams of four and one team of three.

# Let's go!

We started the week together on a kickoff call - reviewing teams, the structure of the week, and sharing some laughs. A daily update in slack from each team lead helped everyone stay in the loop and sparked inspiration from other teams' ideas and work. We ended the week with a call where each team took 20 minutes to present their work.

The structure of the week was intentionally light to leave as much space as possible for focused project work. A few of us who were not participating covered production issues and bugs for the week, which were minimal.
