  - What does success look like?
    - Is it a prototype? Is it a mockup? Who sees the outcomes? Is it for R&D or for the whole company?
    - Visualize the last day. How do you want it to go? What would a successful day look like?
    - Who is involved? Who gets the say in things?
  - What is the _why_ for hackweek?
  - When is a good time for the business and the engineering team?
- Logistics
